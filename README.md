A more detailed article of how to clone repos can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

### Step Two

# Design Choices

I was originally going to code the page using the React library, as I prefer writing reusable components and I enjoy the simplicity of using states to get functions working. But on reflection I decided that for just a single page React was too bloated for my needs. So I went back to basics and kept things minimal. I avoided using any frameworks like bootstrap or Materialize for the frontend and I kept the Javascript vanilla. Although this meant I would have to do slightly more work to get things working I felt it was all good practice and a better showcase of my skills.
